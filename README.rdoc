== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.1.3 / Rails version 4.1.6

* System dependencies: use 'bundle install' to install all the gem files


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
